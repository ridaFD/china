## 📝 API Integration Details

### Authentication

The application uses HMAC-MD5 signature authentication as required by Alibaba's API:

1. Request parameters are sorted alphabetically
2. A signature string is generated by concatenating all parameters
3. HMAC-MD5 hash is created using the App Secret
4. The signature is added to the API request

### Available Endpoints

#### GET `/api/products`
Fetch a list of products

**Query Parameters:**
- `keyword` (optional): Search term
- `page` (optional): Page number (default: 1)
- `pageSize` (optional): Items per page (default: 20)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "products": [...],
  "total": 100,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

#### GET `/api/products/[id]`
Fetch detailed information for a specific product

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "product": {
    "id": "123",
    "subject": "Product name",
    "price": 99.99,
    "imageUrl": "https://...",
    "description": "...",
    ...
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS. To customize the design:

1. Edit `tailwind.config.ts` for theme customization
2. Modify component styles in their respective files
3. Update global styles in `src/app/globals.css`

### Mock Data

If you're testing without API credentials, the application automatically uses mock data. You can customize the mock products in:
- `src/app/api/products/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Mock Data Showing Instead of Real Products

**Issue**: The application displays mock products even though you've configured API credentials.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct credentials
2. Check that your API application is approved on Alibaba Open Platform
3. Ensure API permissions are granted for product search and detail endpoints
4. Check the browser console and server logs for error messages

### API Request Failures

**Issue**: API requests return errors or fail.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your App Key and App Secret are correct
2. Check that your IP address is whitelisted (if required by Alibaba)
3. Ensure you haven't exceeded API rate limits
4. Check the API endpoint URL is correct

### Images Not Loading

**Issue**: Product images don't display.

**Solutions**:
1. Add 1688.com image domains to `next.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   images: {
     remotePatterns: [
       {
         protocol: 'https',
         hostname: '**.1688.com',
       },
     ],
   }
   ```
2. Restart the development server after configuration changes
