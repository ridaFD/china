# üè™ Real 1688.com Store IDs

## Problem
The generated store IDs are fake and don't exist in 1688.com database, so clicking on stores shows no products.

## Solution
We need to replace the fake store IDs with **real 1688.com store IDs**.

## ‚úÖ Known Working Store IDs

Here are some **real, verified 1688.com store IDs** that work with the API:

### **Working Store IDs:**
```
b2b-22129686061252fa5d     (Fashion/General - TESTED ‚úÖ)
b2b-221162226231463a5d     (Electronics - TESTED ‚úÖ)
xingtaisp                  (General Store)
```

## üîç How to Find Real Store IDs

### Method 1: From 1688.com Website
1. Go to https://www.1688.com/
2. Search for a product
3. Click on a supplier's store
4. The store URL will look like: `https://shop1234567890abc.1688.com/`
5. The store ID is: `shop1234567890abc` or `b2b-1234567890abc`

### Method 2: From API Response
When you search for products, the API response includes `storeId` or `shopId`:
```json
{
  "storeId": "b2b-22129686061252fa5d",
  "shopName": "Fashion Store"
}
```

### Method 3: Browse 1688.com Categories
1. Go to specific category pages on 1688.com
2. Find top suppliers
3. Extract their store IDs from URLs

## üìù Store ID Format

1688.com store IDs typically follow these patterns:
- `b2b-XXXXXXXXXXXX` (20-25 characters)
- `shopXXXXXXXXXX` (store name format)
- Some use just numbers/letters

## üöÄ Next Steps

**Option 1: Use Default Working Store ID**
- Set all stores to use known working IDs
- At least products will display

**Option 2: Collect Real Store IDs**
- Manually browse 1688.com
- Extract real store IDs for each category
- Update store data files

**Option 3: Mix Approach**
- Use a few real store IDs
- Cycle through them for different categories
- Add more real IDs gradually

## üí° Recommendation

Start with **Option 1** - use the verified working store ID for all stores temporarily, so users can at least see products. Then gradually replace with category-specific real store IDs.
