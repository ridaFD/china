## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation

**Issue:** We only have 2 verified real store IDs, so:
- All fashion stores show products from the same fashion supplier
- All non-fashion stores show products from the same general supplier
- Different stores in the same category show identical products

**Example:**
- "Women's Clothing Store" ‚Üí shows products from fashion store
- "Women's Dress Factory" ‚Üí shows **same** products from fashion store
- "Candles & Fragrances Store" ‚Üí shows products from electronics/general store
- "Vases & Planters Store" ‚Üí shows products from electronics/general store (not vases!)
