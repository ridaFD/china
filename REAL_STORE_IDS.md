## ⚠️ Current Limitation

**Issue:** We have 5 verified real store IDs, but:
- Stores in the same category group still show identical products
- Different "Women's Clothing" stores show the same 161 fashion products
- Different "Vases & Planters" stores show the same 103 vase products

**Example:**
- "Women's Clothing Store 1" → shows products from fashion store
- "Women's Clothing Store 2" → shows **same** products from fashion store
- "Vase Store 1" → shows products from vase store
- "Vase Store 2" → shows **same** 103 vase products

**✅ Improvement:** Products are now MORE RELEVANT to categories!
